# Rosalind

This repository is a collection of my solutions to Rosalind (http://rosalind.info/) bioinformatics problems. By solving these challenges, I aim to deepen my understanding of computational biology concepts and enhance my problem-solving skills in the field of bioinformatics.

This journey not only helps me gain hands-on experience with algorithms and biological data but also reflects my commitment to continuous learning and growth in this exciting interdisciplinary field.

## Repository Structure

The problems are organized into folders by topics for ease of navigation:

- **Topics:** String Algorithms, Dynamic Programming, Graph Algorithms, Genome Assembly, etc.
- **Problem Details:** Each problem has its own folder containing:

-*README.md:* Problem description and biological context, input/output examples, link to the problem on Rosalind.
-*Solution files:* solution.py: Python implementation.
                solution.R: R implementation (if applicable).
